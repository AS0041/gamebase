My first ever website which is a collection of various categories of games and features like search , filters, login to play and others. A gaming website-Gamebase
## Game developed by myself which is added in the webpage:
#### I have developed a simple jump and hit game using just HTML, CSS and javascript which I have included in Arcade section of categories in the game website under the name tag  My Game
### Description:
The game uses the animation effects of css and javascript function to create the moving effects and uses an image tag to display the objects in the frame. The setInterval() function causes the hurdle to move and a jump function is created by DOM to jump in the game.Finally an alert() function is used to display if a player loses the game by hitting the hurdle.
